###  Email Sending Setup

Agora Abandoned Cart Plugin relies on a function called WP-Cron, and this function only runs when there is a page requested. So, if there are no visits to your website, then the scheduled jobs are not run. Generally this method of sending the abandoned cart notification emails is reliable. However, if you are not very confident about the traffic volume of your website, then you can set a manual cron job via cPanel or any other control panel that your host provides.
